Head over to [API Tokens](https://controld.com/dashboard/api) section, and click on "+", give it a name, choose permission level and press Add.

Tokens can have one of 2 permission levels:

* **Read** - Allows you to perform reads against the API, but won't let you change anything.
* **Write** - Full access token. Allows reads and writes.

Optionally, you can set Allowed IPs when creating the token to restrict where it can be used from.

## Editing an existing token (type and allowed IPs)

You can update a token’s scope and network restrictions at any time:

1. In **API Tokens**, click pencil icon next to the token.
2. Change the **Type** (Read/Write) and/or **Allowed IPs** (comma-separated IPv4/IPv6 or CIDR).
3. Save your changes.

## Using API tokens

Supply your API token in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token for all authenticated API calls.

**Example (cURL)**

```bash
curl https://api.controld.com/users \
  --header 'authorization: Bearer YOUR_FANCY_TOKEN'
```

If successful, you’ll see your account details.

## Invalidating API Tokens

Click the delete button next to the token name you wish to delete.

## Using API Tokens

Supply your API token in the `Authorization` header, as a Bearer token in all authenticated API calls.

```curl
curl https://api.controld.com/users --header 'authorization: Bearer YOUR_FANCY_TOKEN'
```

You should see your account details if you've done this correctly.
